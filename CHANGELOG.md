## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-17

Initial release.

### Added

- **`EpicorSvcs` — 20 Epicor service wrappers, all async.** Every service method ends in `Async`, returns `Task<OperationResult<T>>`, and accepts an optional `CancellationToken`. Services: `BAQ`, `Menu`, `UserCodes`, `GenxData`, `UDX`, `Project`, `Customer`, `Vendor`, `Part`, `SalesRep`, `PayMethod`, `PaymentEntry`, `SerialNo`, `MiscShip`, `SelectedSerialNumbers`, `InvTransfer`, `BomSearch`, `EngWorkBench`, `Quote`, `SalesOrder`.

- **`EpicorClient` facade.** A disposable wrapper that holds one configured session and lazy-constructs each service on first access. The recommended entry point — one connection, many services, all disposed together.

- **`OperationResult<T>` return type.** The standard return for every service call. Carries success/failure state, the typed value (on success), an error message and HTTP status (on failure), the resource path, and the raw `JObject` response as an escape hatch. Reading `Value` on a failure returns `default(T)` rather than throwing, so the `IsFailure` check is mandatory.

- **Typed DTOs for the practical core of every BO.** `Customer`, `Part`, `OrderHed`, `OrderDtl`, `Quote`, `UDRow`, and ~35 more, in `EpicorSvcs/Dtos/`. DTOs ship only the columns every Epicor install has; install-specific `_c` columns are intentionally not modeled and remain accessible via `OperationResult.RawResponse`.

- **`UDXSvc` column-legend convention.** A row may declare what each generic UD column means by encoding a `column:meaning` map into `Character10`. Helpers `UDXSvc.BuildColumnLegend` and `UDXSvc.ParseColumnLegend` build and parse the encoding; `UDRow.ToMappedValues()` re-keys a row's values by their declared meanings. A convention only — the framework does not enforce it.

- **Typed-projection pattern (`GetRowsAsync<T>`).** Generic service methods that let callers receive responses as their own narrow DTO with just the columns they need, ignoring the rest. Used by `MenuSvc.GetRowsAsync<T>` and similar.

- **Orchestrators split into `*Svc.Workflows.cs` partial-class files.** Composed multi-call operations (`NewOrderAsync`, `MoveInventoryAsync`, `AddMtlsAsync`, etc.) live separately from the thin BO wrappers in `*Svc.cs`. Both files declare the same `public partial class`. The split is for contributors; callers see one unified service.

- **`RESTServices` — HttpClient-based transport.** Authentication (Basic auth and v2 OData API key), session management, URL building, JSON error handling. Built on `HttpClient`. Transport failures surface the underlying cause (DNS, connection refused, TLS) by walking the inner-exception chain rather than reporting only the generic outer message.

- **`FileHandling` — Excel and email helpers.** `FileProcessing.EmailReport` runs the canonical "data → Excel/CSV → email" pipeline. Excel reading and writing via ClosedXML (`ExcelReader` / `ExcelWriter`), CSV via direct serialization. SMTP via `Emailer.Send`, which dispatches to `System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient` on .NET Framework and `MailKit.Net.Smtp.SmtpClient` on .NET 8.0+ — same public API, same configuration, same behavior across both targets. Supports optional STARTTLS and authentication via `SMTPPort` / `SMTPEnableSsl` / `SMTPUsername` / `SMTPPassword` settings. Email-related DTOs (`EmailSpecs`, `EMailMeta`) live in `FileHandling/Dtos/`.

- **`EpicorSvcDemo` — end-to-end runnable sample.** Runs a BAQ, builds an Excel attachment, emails it. The canonical "this is what Keri does" example.

- **`EpicorSvcPOCs` — per-feature runnable examples.** Five labeled scenarios (UserCodes, Part, UDX, SalesOrder, MenuTree) demonstrating reads, the column-legend convention, the typed-projection pattern, and gated writes. Write operations require `KERI_POC_ALLOW_WRITES=true`; otherwise they dry-run and print the payload they *would* send.

- **`KineticRESTIntegrator.Tests` — xUnit unit test project.** 52 offline, deterministic tests covering `OperationResult<T>` factories and extensions, `UDRow` serialization behavior (including the `[JsonProperty(NullValueHandling.Ignore)]` design on Date columns), and the `UDXSvc` column-legend helpers. Runs without an Epicor connection.

- **Three credential sources, layered.** Programmatic session (for user-facing apps and multi-tenant scenarios), `App.config` (per-developer local), and environment variables (CI / production / containers). Sources stack: programmatic bypasses both others; env vars override `App.config` row by row.

- **Environment selector via `DefaultEnvironment`.** Named environments (`live`/`pilot`/`test`) defined once in `Env*` settings; `DefaultEnvironment` selects which to use. Per-run override via `EPICOR_ENV`, per-block override via `new EpicorClient("pilot")`, literal-URL override for one-off connections.

- **Multi-target build: `net48` and `net8.0`.** The three library projects (`RESTServices`, `EpicorSvcs`, `FileHandling`) each produce both `net48` and `net8.0` binaries. Consumers on .NET Framework get the `net48` build; consumers on .NET 8.0+ get the `net8.0` build. Public API is identical across both targets. Consumer projects (`EpicorSvcDemo`, `EpicorSvcPOCs`, the test project) remain single-target `net48`.

- **Apache License 2.0.** See [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [NOTICE](NOTICE).

### Notes

- **Pre-1.0.** The API may change in 0.x releases without a deprecation period. Production use at one site; not yet independently reviewed by another team.
- **Target frameworks: `net48` and `net8.0`.** The library multi-targets .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 8.0. The internal SMTP implementation differs (`System.Net.Mail` on net48, MailKit 4.16.0+ on net8.0) but the contract is identical.
